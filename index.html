      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Welcome to my photography website! My name is Rajeev and I am a passionate photographer with a love for capturing the beauty of the world around us.
        I first picked up a camera when I was just a teenager and fell in love with the way it allowed me to see the world in a new light. Whether it's a stunning landscape, a candid moment, or a carefully orchestrated shot, I am always on the lookout for new and interesting subjects to photograph.        
        Over the years, I have honed my skills and developed my own unique style. My work is characterized by a focus on natural light, an eye for detail, and a love of capturing the fleeting moments of life. I shoot a wide range of subjects, including landscapes, portraits, and events, but my true passion is travel photography. I love to explore new places and capture the essence of the cultures and people I encounter.        
        In my free time, I also enjoy teaching photography to others and helping them to develop their own skills and vision. I believe that photography is not just about taking pictures, but about telling stories and capturing memories that will last a lifetime.        
        I invite you to take a look around my website and explore my portfolio. I hope that my work will inspire you to see the world in a new way and to pick up a camera and start capturing your own memories.        
        Thank you for visiting my website!
